<h1>Newsletter 3/2025 — Camarate, 45 Years Later — Interruption as a Crisis Device</h1>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> 4 de Dezembro de 2025</p>

<h2>Resumo</h2>
<p>Forty‑five years later, Camarate remains an unresolved fracture with no unified narrative.
The cabinet examines the Cessna crash as an interruption — not merely an accident — shaped by post‑PREC instability and hidden interests.
This edition does not aim to solve, but to interrupt forgetting: some fractures never heal, they only shift.</p>

<p><strong>Full content available in Portuguese. English summary for context only.</strong></p>

<h2>Premium Archive</h2>
