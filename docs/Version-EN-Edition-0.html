<h1>Edition 0 — Europe in DEFCON 3, France in Cobra Mode</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 21 October 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The French political crisis exposes the institutional fragility of Europe. 
The rapid nomination, resignation and reinstatement of Sébastien Lecornu reveal a system with no alternatives and no clear command. 
Macron governs without a parliamentary majority, the opposition is fragmented, and the continent operates under a political DEFCON: permanent alert with no strategic direction. 
The <em>Cobra</em> metaphor highlights the contrast between fictional leadership and a European reality defined by strategic suspension.
