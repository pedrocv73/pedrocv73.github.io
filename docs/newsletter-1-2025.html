<h1>Newsletter 1/2025 — Rhetoric as a Fault Line</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 November 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The first issue of <em>Fracture Lines</em> introduces the <strong>Crisis Cabinet</strong> as an editorial device to examine political rhetoric that pushes the boundaries of democratic norms. 
Triggered by Ventura’s statement about “three Salazars”, the text argues that the real subject is not the politician but <strong>the architecture of editorial decision‑making</strong> — what is published, what is withheld, and the institutional reasoning behind each choice. 
Each character in the cabinet embodies a different analytical function, creating a multi‑layered reading of language as a tool of tension. 
This inaugural edition sets the tone for future essays focused on Portugal, Europe, informal networks and strategic simulations.
