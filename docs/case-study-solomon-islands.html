    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Solomon Islands have emerged as a critical node in Indo‑Pacific strategic competition. China has consolidated 
      influence through economic investment, political alignment, and a security agreement that reshapes the regional balance.

      in the South Pacific.
