<h1>Newsletter 1/2026 — Democracy is not exportable.</h1>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> 18 January 2026</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>TThis edition examines why democracy and economic models cannot be exported.
Political systems depend on culture, history and operational structures — and no model survives outside its native ecosystem.
Through the Crisis Cabinet, we contrast Latin and Anglo‑Saxon frameworks using history, realpolitik and the real‑estate metaphor to show why certain models simply 
do not function outside their native operating environment.</p>

<p><strong>Full content available in Portuguese. English summary for context only.</strong></p>
