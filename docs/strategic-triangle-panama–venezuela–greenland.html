    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This micro‑paper examines 150 years of United States foreign policy through three interconnected
      case studies — Panama, Venezuela and Greenland — which reveal a consistent logic of hemispheric control.
      The analysis shows how Washington alternates between the Monroe Doctrine and Big Stick diplomacy,
      or combines both, depending on risk levels, intervention costs and the presence of external powers.
      Rather than ideological doctrines, these tools operate as flexible instruments of a single strategic aim:
      preventing the Western Hemisphere and the North Atlantic from becoming permeable to rival influence.
