<h1>Newsletter 1/2026 — Democracy is not exportable.</h1>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> 2 January 2026</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This text uses the phrase "democracy is not exportable" to show that values ​​such as democracy and human rights only function where there are institutions 
capable of sustaining them. Through the characters of the Crisis Cabinet, we show how the attempt to universalize Western models generates paradoxes, resistance, 
and instability—from global geopolitics to post-colonial Africa. The conclusion is clear: without institutional stability, there is no legal security, nor a 
mature real estate market. Real estate thus becomes a mirror of political solidity—and this solidity is never imposed from the outside in.</p>
