<h1>Newsletter 4/2026 — Reactive drive — when systems align under pressure</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 9 February 2026</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Europe appears united, but its unity is reactive — driven by pressure, not conviction. 
History shows that systems held together by fear collapse once the stimulus fades. 
Real estate mirrors this dynamic: apparent stability sustained by external forces. 
Both Europe and the market function under moderate pressure — when it rises, structural fragility emerges.
