<h1>Newsletter 4/2025 — Belém as a Trap: Realpolitik and the Invisible Territory</h1>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> 18 December 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Belém appears as a political trap: a presidential victory that could dissolve a party from within.
The cabinet links this logic to real estate, where stalled licenses and unfinished projects expose invisible fractures in the territory.
Realpolitik operates in institutions and in cities — victories that quietly turn into defeats.</p>
