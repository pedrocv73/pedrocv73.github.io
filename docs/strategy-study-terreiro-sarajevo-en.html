    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A comparative analysis of the 1908 regicide in Lisbon and the 1914 assassination in Sarajevo, showing how both
      events expose the structural fragility of political regimes already under severe strain. The study highlights
      the role of social tensions, institutional erosion and the inability of political elites to recognise the depth
      of the crises preceding both collapses.
