<h1>Newsletter 3/2026 — Belém as a Realpolitik Trap, Territory and the First Round</h1>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> 29 January 2026</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This text reads the first round as an institutional stress test, where apparent victories may expose deeper structural weaknesses. It examines how high offices 
reshape party dynamics and how territory operates as a silent stage of Realpolitik. The real estate metaphor highlights that the most significant fractures 
are invisible, urban, and systemic.</p>
