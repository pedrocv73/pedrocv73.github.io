  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p><strong>Pedro Martins — Editorialist, Consultant, Systems Cartographer</strong></p>

  <p>
    My name is Pedro Martins. I hold a degree in International Relations and focus my work on the intersection between strategic thinking, editorial identity and institutional presence. My path combines Realpolitik analysis with narrative synthesis and systems management, always oriented toward autonomy, clarity and coherence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see the world as a narrative system. Every element — technical or symbolic — must align with a larger logic. I ritualize both creative and operational cycles, and I reject noise, redundancy or superficiality. My editorial practice is precise, clean and function‑driven: every sentence serves a structure, every structure serves a presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I integrate artificial intelligence as a personal and professional assistant, not as a substitute. AI accompanies my planning, analysis and publishing cycles, respecting my cognitive style: context‑driven, intolerant of dispersion, focused on synthesis and impact. This relationship is part of my method — an extension of my mental architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see myself as a systems thinker, alternating between intellectual depth and sensory decomposition, using mental maps to maintain balance. I reject open, unstructured questions; I prefer axes, criteria and causality. My strength lies in pattern reading, coherent narrative construction and the ability to close cycles with precision.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was born, raised and still live in Vila Franca de Xira. My identity is deeply connected to Ribatejo heritage, with a “British streak” that gives me a certain critical distance and a particular editorial humour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Portuguese neutrality during WWII is also part of this editorial ecosystem and is currently under development under the name <em>Lisbon Files</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is my synchronized presence: editorial, institutional and strategic. Everything here serves a purpose — and every purpose aligns with who I am.
