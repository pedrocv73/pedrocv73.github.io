<h1>Newsletter 2/2025 — Decolonization as a Fault Line</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 20 November 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Decolonization was rushed, silent, and without democratic transition, leaving a memory archived but never edited.
The cabinet examines three axes: radicalization vs. military moderation, current rhetoric vs. institutional memory, and the Realpolitik that closed the file.
Celebrating democracy requires acknowledging memory as an editorial choice — and understanding how the past still shapes the present.</p>
